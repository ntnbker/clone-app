        </p>
          <p>
            4. We may amend or modify the Platform or the Tradesmen Terms at our sole discretion and at any time.  Any amendments are effective immediately upon publication on the Platform. Your continued use of the Platform indicates your continued acceptance of the General Terms as modified.

            5. These Tradesmen Terms will prevail over any other terms or agreement between you and us.

            1. These Tradesmen Terms apply to you because you have registered as a Tradesmen wishing to provide various maintenance services (“Services”) to property owners (“Owners”) who use the Platform. Owners may be represented by their managing agent (“Agents”).

            2. This Platform only operates as a venue for you to receive job requests, to provide Services to various Owners.

          <p>
            5. Each Service Agreement is a separate agreement between the you and the Owner. We are not a party to the Service Agreement in any way, and its formation will not, under any circumstance, create an employment between us and you. Nothing in these Tradesmen Terms or otherwise will or is intended to establish a relationship of partnership, agency or employment between us and you, and it is the intention of the parties that any such relationship is expressly denied.
        </p>
          <p>
